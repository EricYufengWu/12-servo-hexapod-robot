# 12-servo-hexapod-robot
I recently started building a simple hexapod robot as a personal project. My intention is to get a fundamental, thorough experience from designing to building a robot (this includes fabricating the structures, designing custom PCB for the microcontroller and the servo driver, doing some programming on a ESP8266, basic IoT, etc.). This is an ongoing project, so I will be frequently updating this repository.
